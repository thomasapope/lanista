# lanista
## Description
A deckbuilding card game about training gladiators to fight in the roman arena and gain glory for your lanista.

I started this as part of a college game design course, but I have decided to continue work on it in my free time. Please note: this is still a work in progress. There are still a lot of kinks to work out through playtesting.
