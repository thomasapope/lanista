# lanista
## Description
A deckbuilding card game about training gladiators to fight in the roman arena and gain glory for your lanista.

I started this as part of a college game design course, but I have decided to continue work on it in my free time. Please note: this is still a work in progress. There are still a lot of kinks to work out through playtesting. Most of the art used is also placeholder. I will eventually create more finished art for the final game, but I am currently more focused on the design and playability of the game.


### Software Used
- Art: Krita
- Layout and printing: Inkscape with the [countersheet extension](https://github.com/lifelike/countersheetsextension)
